## On Friday 5th oct 2018 I(Anurag) and Sreelekha had a client meeting with Dr. Hoot and he has suggested following changes in the presence of Dr. Case.
Client comments (with mentor review)
1.	[Naveen] 'Password doesn’t match' needs to be paraphrased. "Passwords do not match." (Please add DONE when the comment has been incorporated into our plan.) 
2.	[Naveen] 'User is not register' also needs to be paraphrased "User is not registered."
3.	[Shivani]Make sure not to give any reason for the login failure - we will remove this later, after we confirm the process is working. Add to GDP2 requirements.
4.	[Shivani]Make a cw icon which represents codeword - yes - and replace in the upper left corner of the navbar. Add a new user story to MVP 3{?).
5.	[Naveen nuggu]Add a + button to add a course
6.	[Ujjawal]Warning screen should stay bit longer - how long? add this requirement and your delay in seconds to the user story.
7.	[Ujjawal]Instructor ability to create a course needs to be added. Yes - but is not a part of our current MVP
8.	[Chaithanya]Email address should not be case sensitive – true, add to list of requirements for MVP 2. 
9.	[Chaithanya]Logout should be easy without going through many steps - add an "exit door" icon to the top level navbar (MVP 3?)
10.	[Anurag]There should be an icon for logout - yes - see above.
11.	[Srimai]Need to add a search icon - NEW FUNCTIONALITY - need to add a GDP 2 user story. Talk to client - and get more details
12.	[Srimai]In student Interface, Create or delete codeword set should be removed - true - where is our sketch of the student view?
13.	[Vyashnavi]It is not auto filling the details like email ID - NEW NON-CRITCAL FUNCTIONALITY - if client wants autofill, please add user story to GDP 2.
14.	[Naveen nuggu]CRN needs to be removed - true. CRN is not in any user story. Use our sample data - where is our sketch of the instructor view?
