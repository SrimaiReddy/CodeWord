I, Srimai had an meeting and we discussed the user stories of MVP1 and MVP2 which are done, tested and which all are accepted by the client. We did some changes in the user stories according to the client Instructions and we had drawn the UI sketches for the MVP3 plan user stories like Student should be able to see the courses on their home page, instructor wants to see the list of courses those are active and Instructor wants to see the percentage of students who accessed the codewords in that course.

Vyshnavi, Shivani and naveen chandaluri had an discussion for 3 hours about the coursestudent controller and added some functionality to the coursestudent controller. And checked all the pages of the project and made some changes.
