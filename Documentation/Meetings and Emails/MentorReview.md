|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|----------|
| 1  | 'Password doesn’t match' needs to be paraphrased. "Passwords do not match."                                                                              | Naveen                  | Done   |          |
| 2  | 'User is not register' also needs to be paraphrased "User is not registered."                                                                            | Naveen                  |        |          |
| 3  | Make sure not to give any reason for the login failure -  we will remove this later, after we confirm the process is working.  Add to GDP2 requirements. | Shivani                 |        |          |
| 4  | Make a CW icon which represents codeword - yes -   and replace in the upper left corner of the navbar.   Add a new user story to MVP 3{?).               | Anurag                  |        |          |
| 5  | Add a + button to add a course                                                                                                                           | Naveen Nuggu            | Done   |          |
| 6  | Warning screen should stay  bit longer - how long?  add this requirement and your delay in seconds to the user story.                                    | Ujjawal                 |        |          |
| 7  | Instructor ability to create a course needs to be added.  Yes - but is not a part of our current MVP                                                     | Ujjawal                 |        |          |
| 8  | Email address should not be case sensitive – true, add to list of requirements for MVP 2.                                                                | Chaithanya              |        |          |
| 9  | Logout should be easy without going through many steps -  add an "exit door" icon to the top level navbar (MVP 3?)                                       | Sravya                  |        |          |
| 10 | There should be an icon for logout - yes - see above.                                                                                                    | Chaithanya              |        |          |
| 11 | Need to add a search icon - NEW FUNCTIONALITY - need to add a GDP 2 user story.  Talk to client - and get more details                                   | Srimai                  |        |          |
| 12 | In student Interface, Create or delete codeword set should be removed - true -  where is our sketch of the student view?                                 | Srimai                  |        |          |
| 13 | It is not auto filling the details like email ID - NEW NON-CRITCAL FUNCTIONALITY -  if client wants autofill, please add user story to GDP 2.            | Vyashnavi               |        |          |
| 14 | CRN needs to be removed - true. CRN is not in any user story.  Use our sample data - where is our sketch of the instructor view?                         | Naveen Nuggu            | Done   |          |


## We had a Client meeting on Oct, 10th with Dr. hoot along with me(Ujjawal), Anurag, Naveen Nuggu and Sravya and we demonstrated our app. Following was his suggestions after viewing everything meticulously:

| ID | Client's Comment                                                                                                                                                                                              | Developer Working on It | Status | Mentor's Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01 | Application must be light weight. So using image and storing it might slow the application.                                                                                                                   |                         |        | True - there are no images in the user stories - remove this functionality. If client wants it, add the associated user stories to GDP 2 - do not incorporate un-specified functionality this semester.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 02 | Think about the impact on performance if we store the images.                                                                                                                                                 |                         |        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 03 | Talk with mentor, whether to add images/icons or not. It also may be expensive w.r.t space.                                                                                                                   |                         |        | Where is the paper sketch you must review with your client/mentor first? Remove images - this is not part of your specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 04 | If using images/icons, it must fit and look perfectly (responsive) in mobile screen.                                                                                                                          |                         |        | DELETE all references to this new volunteer “images” functionality - as a boss, I don't like paying for work that I've not hired you to do. No one can charge for any images work - it's costing money just for the additional time it takes to review and delete un-requested features.                                                                |
| 05 | In mobile screen, Instructor is not able to view more than one courses in a single page.                                                                                                                      |                         |        | That is correct. Once course per screen is about enough. You'll typically only have 3-5 active courses - easy to scroll through. Showing all course attributes is required by the user stories for MVP 2 and MVP 3 are likely to take this much space. Team - proceed with the plan given. Modifications are non-critical and should be added to GDP2. |
| 06 | Current design looks good on large screen and bad on small screen                                                                                                                                             |                         |        | Being Mobile ready is a requirement. Remove images & scale text accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 07 | Images/icons are not important things, crucial things are that Instructor’s should be able to view Name and Course and Percentage of students retrieved the code.                                             |                         |        | SEE user stories for all information that must be displayed in the course panel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 08 | Start date is not required for the course.                                                                                                                                                                    |                         |        | Yes - and is defaulted to today. Changes to the course panel are non-critical and can be removed in GDP2. We need them to confirm critical functionality this semester.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 09 | End date of course is not required if the courses would be displayed in an order.                                                                                                                             |                         |        | Yes - and we want to see it to verify defaulting. Changes to the course panel are non-critical and can be removed in GDP2. We need them to confirm critical functionality this semester.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 10 | CRN needs to be removed(Not part of specification)                                                                                                                                                            |                         |        | Team: you must follow the user stories and use our sample data. Add creative ideas to GDP 2 for discussion only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11 | Section should be unique with the semester.                                                                                                                                                                   |                         |        | Team: Read the user stories. There is no Semester / Section / CRN - each course gets one unique string called "Course name" to identify it. We do not have term/semeester/section/crn - we have only a single, unique string.                                                                                                                           |
| 12 | There should be a unique identifier for Instructor. He/she should be able to view Course Name, Semester and Instructor’s identifier(Identifier should be randomly generated)                                  |                         |        | WHAT?? Instructors are uniquely identified by email. They get an email (the ID) and a single name field (just like all users). There is nothing about a randomly-generated identifier in our user stories for this semester. Whatever this refers to is a discussion for GDP 2.                                                                         |
| 13 | There should be some default data which can be changed later like start date can be filled with today’s date (system date) and Instructor can change the data later on.                                       |                         |        | Yes - see our user stories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 14 | Instructor’s Name is required while creating add course in course details.                                                                                                                                    |                         |        | Why is this critical? It is not in our current user stories and should be deferred to GDP 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 15 | There must be two survey URL, pre and post. Currently there is only one URL which should not be default and should not force Instructor to use that URL only(Instructor should have access to change the URL) |                         |        | Correct. Our user stories require displaying 2 urls. Please add them to our sample data. Create/Edit functionality will come later - where are our paper sketches?                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 16 | Start and End date should be viewed by both Instructor and Students but after end date, Instructor should still be able to view the dates which students cannot see after the end date.                       |                         |        | There is currently no requirement for students to view start and end date - only click to view code work. Please work with your client to add a users story to GDP 2 to update the view to show start & end for their active courses, if this is required.                                                                                              |
| 17 | There should be some kind of checkbox to indicate show courses that are expired.                                                                                                                              |                         |        | This semester, our user stories have use show only active courses. However, to fully test functionality, I agree we should show them all - please add a calculated field "IsExpired" to each course. Do not store this - calculate it by comparing today's date with the start & end.                                                                   |
| 18 | The view should look OK in both portrait as well as in landscape mode.                                                                                                                                        |                         |        | Reasonably so. It's a pretty good expectation that this app, like most non-video/gaming apps will be typically used in portrait mode. If beautiful landscape mobile is desired, add to GDP 2.                                                                                                                                                           |
