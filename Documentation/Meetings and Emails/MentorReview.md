|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|----------|
| 1  | 'Password doesn’t match' needs to be paraphrased. "Passwords do not match."                                                                              | Naveen                  | Done   |          |
| 2  | 'User is not register' also needs to be paraphrased "User is not registered."                                                                            | Naveen                  |        |          |
| 3  | Make sure not to give any reason for the login failure -  we will remove this later, after we confirm the process is working.  Add to GDP2 requirements. | Shivani                 |        |          |
| 4  | Make a CW icon which represents codeword - yes -   and replace in the upper left corner of the navbar.   Add a new user story to MVP 3{?).               | Anurag                  |        |          |
| 5  | Add a + button to add a course                                                                                                                           | Naveen Nuggu            | Done   |          |
| 6  | Warning screen should stay  bit longer - how long?  add this requirement and your delay in seconds to the user story.                                    | Ujjawal                 |        |          |
| 7  | Instructor ability to create a course needs to be added.  Yes - but is not a part of our current MVP                                                     | Ujjawal                 |        |          |
| 8  | Email address should not be case sensitive – true, add to list of requirements for MVP 2.                                                                | Chaithanya              |        |          |
| 9  | Logout should be easy without going through many steps -  add an "exit door" icon to the top level navbar (MVP 3?)                                       | Sravya                  |        |          |
| 10 | There should be an icon for logout - yes - see above.                                                                                                    | Chaithanya              |        |          |
| 11 | Need to add a search icon - NEW FUNCTIONALITY - need to add a GDP 2 user story.  Talk to client - and get more details                                   | Srimai                  |        |          |
| 12 | In student Interface, Create or delete codeword set should be removed - true -  where is our sketch of the student view?                                 | Srimai                  |        |          |
| 13 | It is not auto filling the details like email ID - NEW NON-CRITCAL FUNCTIONALITY -  if client wants autofill, please add user story to GDP 2.            | Vyashnavi               |        |          |
| 14 | CRN needs to be removed - true. CRN is not in any user story.  Use our sample data - where is our sketch of the instructor view?                         | Naveen Nuggu            | Done   |          |
